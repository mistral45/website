I made one "website" to connect all of the tiny projects I make while learning JS,HTML and CSS
index-sidebar.html contains links to all of them, earliest being at the top, most recent at the bottom, with the exception of "current project" which is the tab where I write them (and later move to other tabs when I'm done)
