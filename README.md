I made one "website" to connect all of the tiny projects I make while learning JS,HTML and CSS
index-sidebar.html contains links to all of them, earliest being at the top, most recent at the bottom, with the exception of "current project" which is the tab where I write them (and later move to other tabs when I'm done)

Most of them (The ones that have an actually nice looking CSS) come from this 12h tutorial:

The ones that look visually unpleasant are my own experiments
