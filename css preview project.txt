2 sections:

    first section:

    Most common options and settings for CSS

    - check boxes
    - radio boxes
    - sliders (?)
    - text boxes (?)
    - whatever other stuff i need

    Second section:
    Showcase of the picked options
    either only for 1 selected element or for all of them at once

switches
ternary operators
